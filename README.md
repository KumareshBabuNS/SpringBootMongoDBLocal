<h1> Spring Boot MongoDB Local/Cloud Demo </h1>

The following demo, goes through how to bind to a data service in IBM Bluemix which is cloud aware. 
The goal is to show how you can develop offline locally and then push the application to IBM Bluemix 
which will auto bind to a MongoDB service automatically and is aware it's running in the cloud and setup 
a data source correctly for this. The goal should be a smooth transition from local execution of an application 
on a developers desktop to a test environment in IBM Bluemix which is powered by Cloud Foundry

See link below for instructions on how to test / run and then deploy to IBM Bluemix
